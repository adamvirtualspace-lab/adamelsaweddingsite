# Adam & Elsa — Wedding Invitation

Single-page wedding invitation. 24 October 2026 · Golden Boutique Hotel, Jakarta.
Akad 12.30 WIB · Resepsi 16.00 WIB.

Plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step. See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for design decisions.

**Live site:** https://adamvirtualspace-lab.github.io/adamelsaweddingsite/ (GitHub Pages, deployed from `main`)

- With a guest's name: https://adamvirtualspace-lab.github.io/adamelsaweddingsite/?to=Nama+Tamu
- Without the 3D opener (straight onto the invitation, lighter for older phones): https://adamvirtualspace-lab.github.io/adamelsaweddingsite/?to=Nama+Tamu&simple

The opening screen is a low-poly 3D model of the Golden Boutique Hotel ([gate3d.js](gate3d.js), Three.js loaded from jsDelivr). The opening text (names, guest, "Buka Undangan") sits at the top of the screen with the hotel below it.

- **Arrival:** the camera eases in from the left at eye level and keeps strolling slowly toward the hotel. It sways with the mouse (desktop) or the phone's tilt (gyro; iOS asks for permission on the first tap).
- **The walk:** tapping "Buka Undangan" walks the camera, unhurried, around the fountain and up the red carpet. On the way, QS. Az-Zariyat: 49 shows, then our story ("Perjalanan kami tidak singkat. …") rises line by line. As its last line, "Dan kami ingin merayakannya bersama kalian.", finishes, the hotel doors swing open and the invitation page fades in. A tap during the story skips ahead. The text timings (`AYAT_AT`, `AYAT_MS`, `STORY_MS`) are in [gate3d.js](gate3d.js); the walk is paced to reach the doors as the text ends.

**Sending list:** [daftar-undangan.html](daftar-undangan.html) (https://adamvirtualspace-lab.github.io/adamelsaweddingsite/daftar-undangan.html) lists every invited guest with their link (Bitly for family and groups, NgantenStory for friends), a ready WhatsApp message, and a "Terkirim" tick (saved only on the device you tick it on). It isn't linked from the invitation and asks search engines not to index it. To add a guest, add a line to `SECTIONS` in its script.

The 3D scene is only the front door. The invitation page itself (the "2D site") is a reproduction of the NgantenStory invitation at [inv.nstory.id/adam-elsa](https://inv.nstory.id/adam-elsa/) (template-11): banner, verse, our story, the couple, Akad & Resepsi, countdown, RSVP, Amplop Digital (bank-transfer popup), gallery with lightbox, guestbook and the thank-you photo. On phones it is one column, as in the original. On computers it stays full-screen: full-width sections and photos (landscape versions of the same shots where we have them: the original `01_Banner.jpg` hero, `05_TimingAkadResepsi.jpg`, …) with the content centred, instead of the original's fixed photo panel and 500px column. Styles are in [invite.css](invite.css), photos and line-art in `assets/img/inv/`. If WebGL or the CDN isn't available, the plain gate still works. The spinning record button (music on/off) floats above everything.

**Fonts:** the original template uses three paid fonts (Batusa, Brighton Signature, Monday, all "All Rights Reserved"), so they are not in this repo. Free Google Fonts stand in for them: Urbanist, Allison and Quicksand. If you own licenses for the originals, add `@font-face` rules for them and put their names first in `--font-body`, `--font-sign` and `--font-round` at the top of `invite.css`.

## Run locally

Open `index.html` directly, or serve it (recommended, so relative fetches behave):

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000/?to=Nama+Tamu` — the `to` query param personalizes the greeting on the cover screen (and prefills the RSVP name).

Add `simple` to skip the 3D opener and land straight on the invitation page ("Dear, Nama Tamu" on the hero photo), e.g. `?to=Nama+Tamu&simple` (or just `?simple`). Browsers only let music start after a tap, so it starts on the guest's first tap (or right away, if the browser allows it). A "Scroll" hint runs down the hero's left edge (arrows sliding down a line from under the greeting to the word "Scroll"); it is only a hint (taps go straight through it) and fades once the guest scrolls.

The Claude Code preview (`.claude/launch.json`) serves on port 8811 with `Cache-Control: no-store`, so edits always show on reload.

## Before you launch — placeholders to fill in

- **Google Maps pin**: "Lihat Lokasi" opens the same pin as the original invitation (https://maps.app.goo.gl/CVXyH9ZxdrndSdp88, Golden Boutique Hotel Kemayoran).
- **Background music**: "Tenderness in the Air" from Final Fantasy V, a classical guitar solo (the same recording as the original NgantenStory invitation), in `assets/audio/backsound.mp3` for every device. It was re-encoded from the invitation's file to 128 kbps MP3 with a short fade in/out for smooth looping: `ffmpeg -i in.mp3 -vn -map_metadata -1 -af "afade=t=in:d=1.5,afade=t=out:st=<duration-3>:d=3" -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k out.mp3`.
- **Opening quote**: QS. Az-Zariyat: 49 (Indonesian translation), in the `.inv-verse` section of `index.html` and in the 3D walk (`.gate-ayat`).

## RSVP + guestbook → our NgantenStory invitation

RSVPs that reach the invitation's form also land in the Google Sheet NgantenStory keeps for it, since that's where its RSVP form is wired.

Every RSVP made on this site is also sent to the RSVP form on our NgantenStory invitation (inv.nstory.id/adam-elsa, Fluent Forms form 705), the same way that page's own form sends it: name, "Saya akan hadir" / "Maaf tidak hadir", and "Jumlah Tamu" (only for guests who are coming). This site lets guests pick 1–6, but the invitation's form only offers 1 or 2, so for 3–6 it sends 2 and adds the real number to the name, e.g. "Budi Santoso (5 tamu)", so the entry isn't turned down and the count isn't lost. So all RSVPs show up together in the NgantenStory entries list. The settings (`NSTORY_AJAX_URL`, `NSTORY_FORM_ID`, `NSTORY_POST_ID`) are at the top of [script.js](script.js); set `NSTORY_AJAX_URL` to `''` to stop.

The browser sends it cross-site, so it can't read NgantenStory's reply. The guest always sees "Terima kasih", even if NgantenStory rejected the entry (for example if nonce checking or spam protection is switched on for the form). After going live, send one test RSVP and check it appears in the NgantenStory dashboard. Guestbook messages go there too: each one is posted to the invitation's guestbook (CommentPress, i.e. WordPress comments on the adam-elsa page, via `wp-comments-post.php`), so it shows publicly alongside the messages left on the invitation itself. `NSTORY_COMMENTS_URL` at the top of script.js turns this off. Same caveat: the reply can't be read, so leave one test message after going live and check it appears on inv.nstory.id/adam-elsa (WordPress may hold some comments for approval, e.g. ones with several links). This site's guestbook shows the invitation's messages live: it reads them from WordPress's public comments API on inv.nstory.id (which allows this site to read it) when the page opens and every minute after, newest first, so both guestbooks show the same messages. A guest's own message shows straight away and is replaced by the invitation's copy once it appears there (if it never does, it was held for approval or turned down). `NSTORY_WISHES_URL` at the top of script.js turns this off; the Google Sheet copy is then used instead, if set up.

## Wiring up RSVP + Guestbook (Google Sheet)

The RSVP form (name, attendance, number of guests) and the guestbook form (name, message) work right now in **preview mode** (nothing is saved; a guestbook message just shows on the page). To save them to a Google Sheet:

1. Upload [gas/rsvp-sheet.xlsx](gas/rsvp-sheet.xlsx) to Google Drive and open it as a Google Sheet. It has three tabs:
   - **RSVP**: header row only (Timestamp | Name | Attendance | Guests | Message). The website appends here.
   - **Ringkasan**: live totals (replies, hadir, tidak hadir, total guests attending, wishes).
   - **Petunjuk**: these setup steps.
2. File > Settings > Time zone: Jakarta (GMT+7).
3. Extensions > Apps Script: paste [gas/rsvp-endpoint.gs](gas/rsvp-endpoint.gs), then Deploy > New deployment > Web app (Execute as: Me, Who has access: Anyone).
4. Copy the deployment's `/exec` URL and set `RSVP_ENDPOINT_URL` near the top of [script.js](script.js).
5. Reload the site. RSVPs and guestbook messages append to the RSVP tab (a guestbook row has a message but no attendance or guest count), and existing wishes load into the guestbook, newest first, with "x hours ago" times.

If you deployed the Apps Script before October 2026, paste the new [gas/rsvp-endpoint.gs](gas/rsvp-endpoint.gs) and re-deploy (Deploy > Manage deployments > edit > new version), and change **Ringkasan!B3** to `=COUNTIF(RSVP!C2:C5000,"Hadir")+COUNTIF(RSVP!C2:C5000,"Tidak Hadir")` so guestbook messages don't count as RSVP replies.

Don't type rows into the RSVP tab by hand: every row with a message is served publicly to the guestbook.

## Deploying

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) is included — it deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`. To turn it on:

1. Push this repo to GitHub (if not already).
2. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source**, select **GitHub Actions**.
3. Push to `main` — the site will publish automatically. GitHub Pages' free tier comfortably handles far more than 300 views.

If you'd rather self-host on Hostinger instead, just upload the whole project folder (everything except `.github/` and `gas/`, which are dev-only) to your hosting root — it's plain static files, no server requirements.
