# Adam & Elsa — Wedding Invitation

Single-page wedding invitation. 24 October 2026 · Golden Boutique Hotel, Jakarta.
Akad 13.00 WIB · Resepsi 16.00 WIB.

Plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step. See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for design decisions.

The opening screen is a low-poly 3D model of the Golden Boutique Hotel ([gate3d.js](gate3d.js), Three.js loaded from jsDelivr). The camera eases in from the left at eye level, then sways with the mouse (desktop) or the phone's tilt (gyro; iOS asks for permission on the first tap). Tapping "Buka Undangan" walks the camera around the fountain and up the red carpet, and the lobby doors swing open. QS. Az-Zariyat: 49 appears over the white flash, then the guest lands in a low-poly hotel lobby ([lobby3d.js](lobby3d.js)) with photos framed on the walls in three clickable groups:

- **Kedua Mempelai**: a camera tour of Adam's portrait, the couple photo, then Elsa's portrait, with cards naming each and their parents.
- **Lokasi & Tempat**: the map board, plus a card with a Google map, the Akad/Resepsi times, and a "Buka Google Maps" button.
- **Cerita Kami**: turns to the right-wall gallery, where each photo opens on its own.

"Lanjut ke Undangan" opens the invitation. If WebGL or the CDN isn't available, the plain gate still works.

- **Photos:** listed in `PHOTOS` at the top of [lobby3d.js](lobby3d.js) (file, group, wall position, size). To add more to the right-wall gallery, add entries with `group: 'gallery'`.
- **Card text** (names, parents, times) is in the `lobby-card` block of [index.html](index.html).

## Run locally

Open `index.html` directly, or serve it (recommended, so relative fetches behave):

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000/?to=Nama+Tamu` — the `to` query param personalizes the greeting on the cover screen.

## Before you launch — placeholders to fill in

- **Bank account holder name** — in `index.html`, search for `[Nama Pemilik Rekening]`.
- **Google Maps pin** — the "Lihat Lokasi" buttons currently link to a text search for "Golden Boutique Hotel Jakarta". Swap in your exact Google Maps share link if you have a preferred pin (in `index.html`, the two `href="https://www.google.com/maps/..."` links).
- **Background music** — add an MP3 at `assets/audio/backsound.mp3` (any royalty-free track, or a song you two like — check licensing if it's commercial). The site works fine without it; the music button just won't play anything until the file exists.
- **Opening quote** — currently QS. Az-Zariyat: 49 (Arabic + Indonesian translation), in the `.quote-section` of `index.html`. Swap for a different verse/quote if you'd like.

## Wiring up RSVP + Guestbook (Google Sheet)

The RSVP form is built and works right now in **preview mode** (submissions just render on-page, nothing is saved). To persist real submissions to a Google Sheet:

1. Follow the setup steps at the top of [gas/rsvp-endpoint.gs](gas/rsvp-endpoint.gs) (create a Sheet, paste the script into Apps Script, deploy as a Web App).
2. Copy the deployment's `/exec` URL.
3. In [script.js](script.js), set `RSVP_ENDPOINT_URL` near the top to that URL.
4. Reload the site — new RSVPs will append to your Sheet, and existing wishes will load into the Guestbook section on page load.

## Deploying

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) is included — it deploys to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`. To turn it on:

1. Push this repo to GitHub (if not already).
2. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source**, select **GitHub Actions**.
3. Push to `main` — the site will publish automatically. GitHub Pages' free tier comfortably handles far more than 300 views.

If you'd rather self-host on Hostinger instead, just upload the whole project folder (everything except `.github/` and `gas/`, which are dev-only) to your hosting root — it's plain static files, no server requirements.
